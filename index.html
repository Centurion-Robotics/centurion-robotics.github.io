                <p>
                    Are you interested in robotics? Do you plan on taking post-secondary education in a STEM related field? Do 
                    you like working in a team environment? Do you want to make new connections and learn important skills?
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you said yes to any of the questions above, then Centurion Robotics Team is the right place for you!

                    will be able to get into the Centurion Robotics Team. If you did not get into the Centurion Robotics Team, 
                    you can still help us out and be involved by joining our weekly meeting Friday afterschool at FRC's library
                    classroom.

                    <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                    <p>
                        We are a group of Fort Richmond Collegiate students who came together to participate in a FIRST Tech
                        Challenge (FTC) Team. We are motivated to design, build, and program robots to win competitions, but we 
                        also aim to inspire an interest in STEM within students and schools.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        As one of three teams in Manitoba, we hope to guide and mentor other teams in their journey into robotics.

                    <h2>What is FIRST Tech Challenge?</h2>
                    <p>
                        It's way more than building robots. FIRST Tech Challenge teams (up to 15 team members, grades 7-12)
                         are challenged to design, build, program, and operate robots to compete in a head-to-head challenge 
                         in an alliance format.
                    </p>
                    <p>Guided by adult coaches and mentors, students develop STEM skills and practice engineering principles, 
                        while realizing the value of hard work, innovation, and working as a team.
                    </p>
                    <p>The robot kit is reusable from year to year and can be coded using a variety of levels of graphical and 
                        Java-based programming.
                    </p>
                    <p>Teams design and build robots, raise funds, design and market their team brand, and do community outreach 
                        to earn specific awards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each season concludes with regional championship events and an exciting FIRST Championship!
